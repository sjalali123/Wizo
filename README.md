# Wizo README
# TODO TBD
This README file is now modified for Branch1.

The feature or bug fix changes in a set of files are first coded and tested
and when they are ready to be pushed into the main or sub branch of a repo,
they are not pushed directly as that would involve a risk of bugs and issues.

That the change-set is READY FOR COMMENTS BEFORE A PUSH/MERGE, is indicated by
GENERATING A PULL REQUEST i.e. a request for owner of the MAIN / Repo, (which could
be me myself), i.e. a REQUEST TO OWNER TO COMMENT or ACCEPT and PULL IN My PUSH-set.
